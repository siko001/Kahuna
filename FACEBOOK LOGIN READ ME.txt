Facebook log-in can be done if the User is new to kahuna or even if the user already has an account with kahuna.

if the user registers first to Kahuna and after he wants to log in via Facebook it's done without problems,
as long as the email used for Facebook is the same email used to register to kahuna.
if it's not the same, a new profile is created (to kahuna), and any registered products on the registered account (with Kahuna) won't show on the Facebook Log-in(This is a problem I will fix later after doing the exam as I didn't want to lose any time with Unnecessary things)
basically, it will treat the accounts as separate if the emails aren't the same :)


user id in the DB will be the same as the Facebook UserID (i can always adjust this to be like a normal registered user and auto increments)
also Phone number I cannot get the information from Facebook due to privacy
and password the same so I created a hard-coded password for Facebook users.

you can log in through the kahuna portal with the Facebook email (once you have logged in with Facebook) and the password "SorryTookAShortCut:)"

all inputs have input_filters
